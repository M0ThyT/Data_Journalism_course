In this repository I have a small notebook that goes through two examples of how to Use selenium. 
I have also added the geckodriver file you will need to run the selenium script. 
All you need to do is change the working directory file and the path file of where the geckodriver file is (starting from your working directory). 
Feel free to reach out if you have any questions. 
Good luck!
